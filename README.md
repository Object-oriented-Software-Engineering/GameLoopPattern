# Game Loop Pattern 

This example illustrates the a simple game physics engine implementing Euler integration for simulating the drop of a bomb.
The application is a WPF project that uses a thread pool thread  to simulate the game loop. The game loop is a pattern that is used in game development to simulate the game world. The game loop is a simple loop that runs continuously and updates the game world based on the time that has passed since the last update. The game loop pattern is used to create a smooth and consistent game experience.

It uses game loop pattern to estimate the new bomb position and speed incrementing the time by the delay it takes to calculate a frame
